# NetworkTrafficLinearReg
A practice implementation of a linear regression machine learning algorithm for predicting network traffic capacity utilization.

`/resources/` contains the training set, and `/src/` holds the code. The results it is giving in its current state are inaccurate, so if you have insights into how this can be improved, I'd love to hear your thoughts as an Issue on the repo.
